Assessment and Plan:
1. Non-small cell lung cancer: The patient completed four cycles of chemotherapy with a partial response. The patient will be scheduled for a follow-up CT scan in three months. Additionally, the patient will be referred to radiation oncology for evaluation of potential radiation therapy.
2. Fatigue, weight loss, and night sweats: Likely related to cancer and chemotherapy. The patient will be encouraged to maintain a balanced diet and exercise as tolerated. A nutritionist referral will be provided for further dietary support.
3. Anemia: Mild anemia likely secondary to chemotherapy. The patient will be prescribed oral iron supplementation and asked to follow up with the primary care physician in two weeks for lab reevaluation.

The patient was educated on the importance of adhering to the prescribed treatment plan and monitoring for any new or worsening symptoms. The patient verbalized understanding and agreed to follow up as recommended.
