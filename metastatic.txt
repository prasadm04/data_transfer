Assessment and Plan:
1. Suspected metastatic non-small cell lung cancer: New onset of lower back pain and worsening fatigue raise concern for metastatic disease. The patient will undergo an MRI of the lumbar spine to evaluate for vertebral metastasis. The patient will also have updated tumor markers and other laboratory tests.
2. Lower back pain: Pending MRI results, the patient will be prescribed a short course of oral NSAIDs and advised to apply heat or ice as needed for pain relief. Physical therapy referral will be considered based on imaging results and clinical findings.
3. Fatigue: The patient will be encouraged to maintain a balanced diet, regular exercise, and adequate sleep. The patient's fatigue will continue to be monitored, and further evaluation may be required based on imaging and laboratory findings.

The patient was educated on the importance of adhering to the prescribed treatment plan and monitoring for any new or worsening symptoms. The patient verbalized understanding and agreed to follow up as recommended.
